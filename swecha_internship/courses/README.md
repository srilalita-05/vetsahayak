# Interactive Programming Notebooks

Welcome to our project! Our mission is to simplify the learning process for beginners interested in programming concepts with a focus on Python, Pandas, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Copilots, Go, and more. Through interactive notebooks, we aim to offer an engaging learning experience that combines theory with practice.

## Roadmap

To complete the following topics
- **Python Basics**
- **Python Intermediate**
- **Pandas Basics**
- **Pandas Intermediate**

> Note: The above list isn't exhaustive and will be updated in the near future 

Please refer to the [Notebooks Division of Work](https://code.swecha.org/workshops/courses/-/wikis/Notebooks---Division-of-Work) wiki to see the detailed list of topics as well as the volunteers who contributed to the notebooks. 

## Features

- **Interactive Notebooks**: Each concept must be explained with an interactive Jupyter notebook that allows you to run code, see results in real-time, and experiment with variations.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials**: Notebooks should be designed to guide you through concepts gradually, building your understanding from the ground up.
- **Real-World Examples**: Notebooks should have scope to apply what users learn with exercises and examples that mimic real-world scenarios.

Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.\n* Attritubes - Attributes are the characteristics of an object.

It operates similarly to lru_cache(maxsize=None) but without a size limit, using a simple dictionary lookup for function arguments. This approach is faster and more lightweight compared to lru_cache().\n\n**@functools.cached_property(func)** - Transform a method of a class into a property whose value is computed once and then cached as a normal attribute for the life of the instance. Similar to property(), with the addition of caching. \n\n**functools.cmp_to_key(func)** - Transform an old-style comparison function to a key function. Used with tools that accept key functions (such as sorted(), min(), max(), heapq.nlargest(), heapq.nsmallest(), itertools.groupby()). This function is primarily used as a transition tool for programs being converted from Python 2 which supported the use of comparison functions.\n\n**@functools.lru_cache(user_function)\n@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False)** - Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves up to the maxsize most recent calls. It can save time when an expensive or I/O bound function is periodically called with the same arguments.\n\n**@functools.total_ordering** - Given a class defining one or more rich comparison ordering methods, this class decorator supplies the rest. This simplifies the effort involved in specifying all of the possible rich comparison operation\n\n**@functools.wraps(wrapped, assigned=WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS, updated=WRAPPER_UPDATES)** - Convenience function for invoking update_wrapper() as a function decorator when defining a wrapper function.

In Python, concurrency is typically achieved through threading, multiprocessing, or asynchronous programming. However, concurrency does not necessarily mean that tasks are executing simultaneously. Instead, tasks may appear to run concurrently by interleaving their execution or by utilizing non-blocking I/O operations.\n\n**Parallelism**, on the other hand, involves the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, where each task runs independently of the others. Parallelism utilizes multiple CPU cores, processors, or even multiple machines to execute tasks concurrently and accelerate computation. In Python, parallelism is achieved through threading, multiprocessing, or distributed computing frameworks.\n\nWhile concurrency and parallelism can both improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, they differ in terms of how tasks are executed:\n\n- Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks and their interactions, often involving tasks with overlapping execution or dependency on external events (I/O operations).\n  \n- Parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously, with each task running independently and potentially utilizing separate CPU cores or processors.\n\nIn summary, while Python provides mechanisms for both concurrency and parallelism, they serve different purposes and have different implications for how tasks are executed and managed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Threading \n\nThreading involves running multiple threads within the same process.

Use the library's connection method to establish a connection.\n\n    Create a Cursor/Object:\n        Create a cursor or object that allows you to execute SQL queries and retrieve results from the database. This cursor/object is used to interact with the database.\n\n    Execute SQL Queries:\n        Use the cursor/object to execute SQL queries against the database. These queries can include data retrieval (SELECT), data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), schema modifications (CREATE, ALTER, DROP), etc.\n\n    Process Results:\n        If executing a SELECT query or any other query that returns results, fetch and process the results returned by the database. Depending on the library, you may use methods like fetchone(), fetchall(), or fetchmany() to retrieve data.\n\n    Handle Errors:\n        Implement error handling to gracefully handle database-related errors such as connection failures, query execution errors, constraint violations, etc. Use try-except blocks or other error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions.\n\n    Commit Changes (For Transactional Databases):\n        If working with a transactional database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), commit changes to the database using the commit() method after executing data modification queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). This ensures that changes are permanently saved to the database.\n\n    Close Connection:\n        Close the database connection once you have finished interacting with the database. This releases database resources and prevents connection leaks.

Python developers appreciate its simplicity—running tests is as easy as running the pytest script in the terminal within the test folder.\n* **Selenium**<br>\n    Selenium is a popular Python-based system for automated testing. There is a robust community behind it, and it supports multiple languages. For parallel scenario orchestration, it also supports cloud grid resources. Developers may simulate user actions in the UI with Selenium’s many specialized pickers.\n* **Nose2**<br>\n    It functions as a test runner, like Pytest, for examples of testing written using different frameworks, such as Selenium or unit test. Testing a project’s user interface (UI) and verifying the code functions of every element is possible with Nose2.\n* **Playwright**<br>\n    Microsoft created the playwright testing framework. Playright is unique among testing frameworks because it can run tests in both armless & head modes. When it comes to integrated testing, Playwright is fairly comparable to Selenium. However, Playwright is superior to Selenium when it comes to testing APIs. A built-in auto-wait function is available. Therefore, it waits for the DOM to finish loading before executing test cases. The dramatist framework works with Python and JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and.NET.\n* **Robot**<br>\n    The robot is a keyword-driven, freely available Python framework to facilitate integration testing. In contrast to other frameworks, Robot lets you write test cases in plain English. For programmers new to testing, it’s a great alternative because it facilitates the creation of test cases that are easier for humans to understand.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"##Sample code for integration testing using Pytest module\n\n# save this as test_calc.py\n\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n    return a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    return a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n    return a / b\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# save this as test_test_calc.py\n\nimport pytest\nfrom test_calc import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n\ndef test_addition():\n    assert add(1, 2) == 3\n    assert add(-1, 1) == 0\n    assert add(0, 0) == 0\n\ndef test_subtraction():\n    assert subtract(5, 2) == 3\n    assert subtract(1, -1) == 2\n    assert subtract(0, 0) == 0\n\ndef test_multiplication():\n    assert multiply(2, 3) == 6\n    assert multiply(-2, 3) == -6\n    assert multiply(0, 100) == 0\n\ndef test_division():\n    assert divide(6, 2) == 3\n    assert divide(10, 2) == 5\n\ndef test_divide_by_zero():\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        divide(5, 0)\n\n        \n        \n        \npytest #To run the tests, you simply execute pytest in your terminal while in the directory containing these files","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Sample test code using the Selenium module in Python which tests the functionality of a login form on a website\n\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\nimport time\n\n# Create a new instance of the Firefox driver\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox()\n\n# Navigate to the login page\ndriver.get(\"https://example.com/login\")\n\n# Find the username and password input fields and the login button\nusername_input = driver.find_element_by_id(\"username\")\npassword_input = driver.find_element_by_id(\"password\")\nlogin_button = driver.find_element_by_id(\"login-button\")\n\n# Enter the username and password\nusername_input.send_keys(\"your_username\")\npassword_input.send_keys(\"your_password\")\n\n# Click the login button\nlogin_button.click()\n\n# Wait for the page to load\ntime.sleep(2)\n\n# Verify that we are logged in by checking for a logout link or some other indicator\nlogout_link = driver.find_element_by_id(\"logout-link\")\n\n# Assert that the logout link is present, indicating successful login\nassert logout_link.is_displayed(), \"Login failed\"\n\n# Close the browser window\ndriver.quit()\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# sample test code for testing arithmetic functions using Nose2 module\n\nfrom math_functions import add, subtract, multiply, divide\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_add(self):\n        self.assertEqual(add(3, 5), 8)\n        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)\n        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)\n\n    def test_subtract(self):\n        self.assertEqual(subtract(10, 4), 6)\n        self.assertEqual(subtract(5, -2), 7)\n        self.assertEqual(subtract(0, 0), 0)\n\n    def test_multiply(self):\n        self.assertEqual(multiply(2, 3), 6)\n        self.assertEqual(multiply(-2, 3), -6)\n        self.assertEqual(multiply(0, 100), 0)\n\n    def test_divide(self):\n        self.assertEqual(divide(10, 2), 5)\n        self.assertEqual(divide(6, 2), 3)\n\n    def test_divide_by_zero(self):\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            divide(5, 0)\n\n# This line allows you to run the tests directly using Nose2\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n\n\nnose2 #To run these tests using Nose2, you simply navigate to the directory containing your test files and execute the command","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Sample test code using the Playwright module in Python to automate interactions with a web page\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\ndef test_search():\n    with sync_playwright() as p:\n        browser = p.chromium.launch()\n        page = browser.new_page()\n\n        #

In Python, concurrency is typically achieved through threading, multiprocessing, or asynchronous programming. However, concurrency does not necessarily mean that tasks are executing simultaneously. Instead, tasks may appear to run concurrently by interleaving their execution or by utilizing non-blocking I/O operations.\n\n**Parallelism**, on the other hand, involves the actual simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, where each task runs independently of the others. Parallelism utilizes multiple CPU cores, processors, or even multiple machines to execute tasks concurrently and accelerate computation. In Python, parallelism is achieved through threading, multiprocessing, or distributed computing frameworks.\n\nWhile concurrency and parallelism can both improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, they differ in terms of how tasks are executed:\n\n- Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks and their interactions, often involving tasks with overlapping execution or dependency on external events (I/O operations).\n  \n- Parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously, with each task running independently and potentially utilizing separate CPU cores or processors.\n\nIn summary, while Python provides mechanisms for both concurrency and parallelism, they serve different purposes and have different implications for how tasks are executed and managed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Threading \n\nThreading involves running multiple threads within the same process.

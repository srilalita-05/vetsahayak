The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n\n* **Class** - Collection of objects which contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created\n* **Objects** - Entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.\n* **Attritubes** - Attributes are the characteristics of an object. They are stored as variables within a class and represent the state of the object\n* **Methods** - Methods are functions defined within the scope of a class. They define the behavior of the objects created from that class","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Sample Code for creating class\n\nclass Swecha:\n    def __init__(self, name, age): #name is a attribute\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n    \n    def attendance(self): #method for taking attendance\n        print(f\"{self.name} attended Devdays!\")\n        \n\n#Sample code for object creation for above class\n\nattendee1 = Swecha(\"Arjun\",28) #attendee1 is an object for Class Swecha","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Four Important concepts of OOP \n \n* Encapsulation\n* Abstraction\n* Inheritance\n* Polymorphism","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Encapsulation\nEncapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). \nIt hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionality.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Creating a Base class \nclass Swecha: \n    def __init__(self): \n        self.a = \"Swecha is FOSS movement\"\n        self.__c = \"DevDays is a event for Opensource Developer Community\" \n  \n# Creating a derived class \nclass Devdays(Swecha): \n    def __init__(self): \n  \n        # Calling constructor of Swecha class \n        Swecha.__init__(self) \n        print(\"Calling private member of base class: \") \n        print(self.__c) \n  \n  \n# Driver code \nobj1 = Swecha() \nprint(obj1.a) \n\nobj2 = Devdays()\nprint(obj2.a)\n\n#In the above code, self.a is public variable and accessed by everyone and private variable-\n#of base class is not accessed by derived class object","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Abstraction\n\nAbstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users.

It allows objects to support assignment operations such as obj[key] = value.\n \n* __delitem__(self, key): Deletion method. It allows objects to support deletion operations such as del obj[key].\n \n* __iter__(self): Iterator method. It returns an iterator object that can iterate over the elements of the object.\n \n* __contains__(self, item): Membership test method.

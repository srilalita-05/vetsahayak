They provide a way to modify or extend the behavior of functions without modifying their actual code. Decorators are essentially functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function that usually extends the behavior of the original function.\n\n**How Decorators Work:**\n\n* **Defining a Decorator:** You define a decorator as a regular Python function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function.\n\n* **Decorating a Function:** You apply a decorator to a function using the **@decorator_name** syntax just before the function definition.\n\n* **Using the Decorated Function:** When you call the decorated function, the decorator intercepts the call and executes its own code before and/or after calling the original function.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"Who are we?\")\n        func()\n        print(\"Open source movement promotes innovation and accesiblity of knowledge for everyone\")\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef swecha():\n    print(\"Swecha is non-profit organisation promotes free and open source\")\n\nswecha()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T12:03:04.832561Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T12:03:04.833001Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T12:03:04.881912Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T12:03:04.832964Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T12:03:04.881006Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Who are we?\nSwecha is non-profit organisation promotes free and open source\nOpen source movement promotes innovation and accesiblity of knowledge for everyone\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Code Explanation\n\n* my_decorator is a decorator function that takes another function (func) as its argument.\n* Inside my_decorator, there's a nested function called wrapper. This function serves as a wrapper around the original function (func). It adds some extra functionality before and after calling the original function.\n* In this case, before calling the original function (func), wrapper prints \"Who are we?\", and after calling func, it prints \"Open source movement promotes innovation and accessibility of knowledge for everyone\".\n* The original function func is called within the wrapper function.\n* The wrapper function is then returned by the decorator.\n* The @my_decorator syntax is used to apply the my_decorator decorator to the swecha function. This means that when swecha is called, it will be wrapped by the my_decorator.\n* Inside the swecha function, it prints \"Swecha is a non-profit organization that promotes free and open source\".\n* When swecha() is called, it triggers the decorated version of the swecha function due to the decorator @my_decorator.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will practice some exercises for decorator.\n1.

They are a special kind of iterator that is defined using a function or a generator expression. Generators use the yield keyword to return data one item at a time, allowing you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing them all in memory at once. This makes generators memory efficient and particularly useful for dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n\n**How Generators Work:**\n\n* **Defining a Generator Function:** You define a generator function using the def keyword, just like a regular function, but instead of using return, you use yield to yield the next value in the sequence.\n\n* **Iterating Over a Generator:** You can iterate over the generator using a for loop or by calling the next() function on the generator object.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def countdown(n):\n    while n > 0:\n        yield n\n        n -= 1\n\nfor i in countdown(5):\n    print(i)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is a generator function named **countdown**.

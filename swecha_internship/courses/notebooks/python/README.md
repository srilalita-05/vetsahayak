# Intermediate Python 101

Welcome to our project! Our mission is to simplify the learning process for beginners interested in programming concepts with a focus on Python, Pandas, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Copilots, Go, and more. Through interactive notebooks, we aim to offer an engaging learning experience that combines theory with practice.

## Features

- **Interactive Notebooks**: Each concept must be explained with an interactive Jupyter notebook that allows you to run code, see results in real-time, and experiment with variations.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials**: Notebooks should be designed to guide you through concepts gradually, building your understanding from the ground up.
- **Real-World Examples**: Notebooks should have scope to apply what users learn with exercises and examples that mimic real-world scenarios.
